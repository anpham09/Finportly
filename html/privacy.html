        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data while using our services. Since Finportly operates using local storage, no personal information such as email addresses or account details is collected or stored.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>All data entered into Finportly, such as company names, addresses, income, and expenses, is stored locally on your device using local storage. This ensures that your data never leaves your device and remains as secure as your device itself.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your data depends on the security measures of your device. We recommend protecting your device with up-to-date antivirus software, strong passwords, and other necessary precautions to maintain data confidentiality.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Finportly does not use third-party services to collect or store any data. As all operations occur locally, there is no data sharing with external entities.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Finportly does not target children under the age of 13. As no data collection or account creation occurs, there is no risk of misuse of personal information for children.</p>
